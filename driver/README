Sapidlib will currently run on two lpmud drivers: FluffOS and MudOS.

If you think FluffOS and MudOS sound similiar, you're absolutely correct -
they both end in OS. Besides that, FluffOS is a fork of the MudOS driver
which means that in simple terms: FluffOS is MudOS with extra. This is
especially true because MudOS hasn't been updated in ages whereas FluffOS
still gets the odd update. 

Which driver should you use? You'll probably want to use FluffOS but you'll
find that older code may not work under FluffOS anymore because FluffOS has
stricter type checking.

You can find the appropriate local_options file in etc/local_options.DRIVER
(replacing DRIVER with the driver you are compiling, ie. fluffos or mudos).
